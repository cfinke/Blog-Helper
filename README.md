Blog Helper
===========
This skill allows you to check your WordPress.com notifications, moderate pending comments, and save blog post ideas as drafts -- no typing required.  You can also use it on self-hosted blogs that are running Jetpack.

To check your notifications, just ask: "Alexa, open Blog Helper and check my notifications." Alexa will read the new ones to you one-by-one, marking each one as read as you listen to it.

You can create draft blog posts with Alexa too. Say, "Alexa, tell Blog Helper to create a new post called 'My thoughts on gardening.'"  This skill will save the post as a draft so you can expound on your ideas later.

Comment moderation has never been easier (or more vocal). "Alexa, ask Blog Helper if I have any new comments," and you'll be able to approve, delete, or mark them as spam.

Example Phrases
===============
Alexa, ask Blog Helper for my notifications.

Start a new post titled "My vacation in Spain."

Do I have any comments to moderate?
